# Dog breed classification
The `ipynb` file in this `repo` has implemented and passed the requirements for Udacity dog breed classification project in deep learning Nano-degree.

## Usage
Following tasks has been carried out and describe in the above said file:-

- An open CV algorithm is used to classify human faces (Used the human face and dog face data set as the inputs)
- Vgg16 is used to develop an algorithm to classify dogs 
- A convolution NN with 4 convolutional layers is developed from scratch to have 10% accuracy over 133 breeds
- Transfer learning is used with the aid of ResNet50 to achieve accuracy of 75%
- An algorithm is developed to classify amongst humans, dogs and other. Further transfer learning algorithm is used to classify the dog breed.

## Restrictions

- `cuda` is needed to run most of the program as it is highly computation intense.
